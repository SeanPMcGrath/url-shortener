-Center submitted url text vertically while showing top part of scrolling texts
-Format for mobile
-Check if port message at the end of the code is still necessary in production
-figure out switching between development and production environments (esp for client js)
-Figure out how to really set up config options in the different files
-Specify fonts so they're constant across browsers
-Add functionality to submit url by hitting enter

Done
-Deploy on Heroku
-Figure out if shortcuts array is ever reset by heroku (ie why I would want to use mongoDB instead of just keeping the array) - resets any time the app is restarted
-Add MongoDB functionality
-Add copy button for short url
-Fix the space for shorturls to account for longer id's
-Add 404 error message (can play around more on deployed version but I think this is working. Hard to test because errors apparently don't get returned on cross domain requests. Request just hangs)
