-Center submitted url text vertically while showing top part of scrolling texts
-Add copy button for short url
-Format for mobile
-Add MongoDB functionality
-Add 404 error message
-Check if port message at the end of the code is still necessary in production
-figure out switching between development and production environments

Done
-Deploy on Heroku
-Figure out if shortcuts array is ever reset by heroku (ie why I would want to use mongoDB instead of just keeping the array) - resets any time the app is restarted
